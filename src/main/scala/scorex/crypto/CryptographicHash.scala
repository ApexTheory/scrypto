/**
  * From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function):
  * "A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which is considered practically impossible to invert,
  * that is, to recreate the input data from its hash value alone. These one-way hash functions have been
  * called "the workhorses of modern cryptography". The input data is often called the message, and
  * the hash value is often called the message digest or simply the digest.

 
  The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
    it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message
    it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash
    it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash
    it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.
